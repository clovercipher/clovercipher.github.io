title: About me
---

My name is Correy (aka Clover) and I have been blogging since October of 2013. I work in the Information Security industry as an cyber intrusion analyst and started this blog as a way to continually learn about the behaviors and techniques utilized by malicious software. Learning about the newest pieces of malware and the motivations behind the authors has been a passion for these last couple of years.  

I have always found the best way to learn about a subject is to become actively involved in investigating it and engaging with peers who have a knowledge about the subject matter. These motivations have led me to create this content which can be used and challenged by others in the InfoSec community.
